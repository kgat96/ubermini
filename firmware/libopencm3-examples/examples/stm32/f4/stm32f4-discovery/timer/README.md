This example demonstrates the use of timers to trigger an interrupt. This
example will toggle two LEDs spelling out the following morse code:

SOS -> ...---...

Where dots are .1s, dashes .2s, gaps .05s and the word pause .5s.

It's intended for the ST STM32F4DISCOVERY eval board. It should blink
the LEDs on the board.

## Board connections
